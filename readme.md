Rair is a work in progress rewrite of radare2 in rust with these goals:
- Native speed.
- Extremely flexible and modern analysis.
- Simpler building system.
- Worry less about undefined behavior.
- Smooth translation to multithreading.
- Extremely stable and well documented API.
- Focusing on correctiness more than focusing on features.
- Avoid legacy systems compatiability.
