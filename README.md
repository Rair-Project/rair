# RAIR  [![License: LGPL v3](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-LGPL%20v3-blue.svg)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0)

**Travis CI:**  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oddcoder/rair.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/oddcoder/rair)

RAIR is a work in progress rewrite of [radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2) in rust with these goals:
- Native speed.
- Extremely flexible and modern analysis.
- Simpler building system.
- Worry less about undefined behavior.
- Smooth translation to multithreading.
- Extremely stable and well documented API.
- Focusing on correctiness more than focusing on features.
- Avoid legacy systems compatiability.

It was hard to decide how to start this project and there was mainly two approaches:

A) start rair completely from scratch.

B) replacing parts from radare till it all becomes written in rust.

~~I prefered the later approach because it will make rair usable right from the begining and it will be testable with [radare2-regressions](https://github.com/radare/radare2-regressions).~~

Ufortunately that didn't work out as expected for many reasons. Idiomatic rust is slightly different from Idiomatic C, where in rust you need to respect a very strict ownership/lifetime model that is almost non existent in C. Also radare2 is moving target and keeping compatiability with such huge system is very hard task on its own.
## Get started

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/oddcoder/rair.git
$ cd rair
$ cargo install
```

## Get involved

Regardless to how skilled/unskilled you are, there will always be something for you to do! I always try to keep the code base clean.
This is list of what you can do from easy to the more challenging:

- Improve this readme.
- Add support for code coverage / travis / and other CI systems
- Document already exisiting functions.
- fix one of `cargo clippy` warnings.
- Refactor the current codebase, there are many long functions and breaking them down is really usefull.
- Write unit tests/ fuzz rair
- imlement one or more of these:
	* rabin2
	* radiff2
	* ragg2
	* rasm2
	* radare2
	* ragg2-cc
	* rarun2
	* rax2
